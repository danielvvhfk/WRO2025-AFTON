# Control Software

This directory contains the code for control software which is used by the vehicle to participate in the competition and which was developed by the participants.

All artifacts required to resolve dependencies and build the project must be included in this directory as well.

## Contents

- **self_driving_car**: Version 2 (Final) - Code in Python for the main microcontroller Rock 3A
- **aftonAPI**: Version 1 - API in Python with Flask to capture images for AI model training
- **afton-smartwheels**: Version 1 - Previous solution implemented for ESP32-S3 hardware with code in C language

## Directory Descriptions

- **self_driving_car**
  - This directory contains the final version of the code written in Python for the main microcontroller Rock 3A. It includes the necessary scripts and modules to control the vehicle and execute the self-driving functions.

- **aftonAPI**
  - This directory contains the API (Version 1) developed in Python using Flask. The API is designed to capture images for AI model training, providing the necessary interface for data collection and processing.

- **afton-smartwheels**
  - This directory contains the previous solution implemented for the ESP32-S3 hardware. The code is written in C language and includes all the necessary components for the control of the vehicle using the ESP32-S3 microcontroller.
